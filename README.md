A collection of scripts not worthy of their own repo

# Disclaimer
Some scripts, such as postInstall and dotfiles, are heavily based on personal prefrence and are not open to input. I will make it obvious when this is the case. You are free to fork and use them, just be advised that contributing to them will be a waste of both your and my time.
